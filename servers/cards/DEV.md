# cards

The current GUI system is a basis but we need to start building GUI on top is a much fater way.

Cards allow the Server to drive the GUI
- Devs and Users can quickly make a GUI.
- no compile or deploy.
- useful for data driven systems like Admin and mod-disco possible.
- when hooked up to our server supporitng CQRS and Functions, it will give a good no code development on top of the modules and widgets we are buildng.
